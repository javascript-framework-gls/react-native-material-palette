# Troubleshooting

### Cannot find module `react` or `react-native`
This error might happen if you're using `haul` and have `react-native-material-palette` symlinked via `yarn link` or `npm link`. In order to fix it, you need to overwrite `webpack.haul.js` and set `resolve.symlinks` to `false`:

```diff
- module.exports = ({ platform }) => ({
+ module.exports = ({ platform }, defaults) => ({
+   ...defaults,
  entry: `./index.${platform}.js`,
+   resolve: {
+     ...defaults.resolve,
+     symlinks: false
+   }
});
```
